            <dd class="type weapon1">The Gewehr 98 is a German bolt action rifle made by Mauser firing cartridges from a 5-round internal clip-loaded magazine. It was the German service rifle from 1898 to 1935, when it was replaced by the Karabiner 98k, a shorter weapon using the same basic design. </dd>

            <dd class="type weapon2">The Karabiner 98 carbine 98 short, often abbreviated Kar98k or K98k and often incorrectly referred to as a “K98” is a bolt-action rifle chambered for the 7.92×57mm Mauser cartridge that was adopted on 21 June 1935 as the standard service rifle by the German Wehrmacht.</dd>

            <dd class="type weapon3">The Type 97 Sniper Rifle is a Japanese bolt-action rifle, based on the Type 38 Rifle. Following the standard practice of the time, it was adapted from an existing infantry rifle. The only difference between this rifle and the original Type 38 is that it had a lightened stock, a 2.5 power telescopic sight and a mid-band setup for a monopod, although later models had this deleted. The rifle entered service in 1937. When fired, the mild 6.5x50mm Arisaka cartridge gave off little flash or smoke and made counter-sniper activity difficult. </dd>

            <dd class="type weapon4">The FN Ballista is a sniper rifle developed by FN Herstal. The company states that the Ballista's design compares with the Remington MSR, the Armalite AR-30, and the Accuracy International AWM. The Remington MSR was selected as the winner of the PSR competition. </dd>

                The PDShP is a series of anti-materiel rifles developed by the Georgian Military Scientific-Technical Center STC DELTA. The weapons are based on a bullpup design and there are different versions, Amr mod-1 and Amr mod-2. Development of the current series was completed in 2013. The development of the rifles was complete in late 2012 to early 2013 but the weapons were not revealed earlier than May 2014. Currently there are two variants available. They are all bullpup configured. The more recent 12.7×108mm version is recoil-operated with a 6 round box magazine feed and has an effective range of 1800–2000 meters. Its development was completed in 2013.

            <dd class="type weapon6">For decades, the South Korean Army did not have a standard-issue sniper rifle. Small numbers of M1C/D Garands were used until they became obsolete in the late 1970s. In the late 1980s, British Trilux-style scopes were fitted to K2 assault rifles. This turned them into designated marksman rifles, but this was not official or widespread. Dedicated foreign-built sniper rifles were bought for special forces and counter-terror units, but the regular army had virtually no interest in sniping. This mindset was unusual, as they had encountered sniper threats during the Korean War and their involvement in the Vietnam War. That began to change after American operations during the Iraq War and the War in Afghanistan.</dd>

            <dd class="type weapon7">The Barrett M82, standardized by the U.S. military as the M107, is a recoil-operated, semi-automatic anti-materiel sniper system developed by the American Barrett Firearms Manufacturing company. Despite its designation as an anti-materiel rifle, it is used by some armed forces as an anti-personnel system. The M107 variant is also called the Light Fifty for its .50 BMG (12.7×99mm NATO) chambering and significantly lighter weight compared to previous applications and the 15% heavier base M82 model. The weapon is found in two variants, the original M82A1 and the bullpup M82A2. The M82A2 is no longer manufactured, though the XM500 can be seen as its successor.</dd>

            <dd class="type weapon8">
                The Steyr IWS 2000 is an Austrian semi-automatic anti-materiel rifle produced by Steyr Mannlicher. IWS stands for Infantry Weapon System. Like many modern anti-tank rifles, and indeed also modern tank guns, it is actually a smoothbore weapon and not a true rifle. This can help accelerate projectiles and increase ballistic effectivenessm, but the lack of rifling imparting an inertial stability requires the projectile have stabilizing fins. It fires a 15.2×169mm armor-piercing, fin-stabilized discarding sabot round (207 mm long), and is the first man-portable rifle to use this type of ammunition.

            <dd class="type weapon9">
                The CheyTac Intervention is an American bolt-action sniper rifle manufactured by CheyTac LLC, which can also be classified as an anti-materiel rifle. It is fed by a 7-round detachable single-stack magazine (an optional 5-round magazine is also available). It is specifically chambered in either .408 Chey Tac or .375 Chey Tac ammunition. CheyTac LLC states that the system is capable of delivering sub-MOA accuracy at ranges of up to 2,500 yd (2,286 m), one of the longest ranges of all modern-day sniper rifles. It is based on the EDM Arms Windrunner. With the passing of Bill Ritchie, the rifles are being serviced by Vigilance Rifles, Inc, run by Bill Ritchie's son.
